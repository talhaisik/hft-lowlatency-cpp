- Low-Latency Algorithm Design
- Systems Programming Techniques

## 🗺 Exploration Roadmap

### Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals
- [x] Move Semantics
- [x] Compile-Time Optimizations
- [x] **Lock-Free Ring Buffer Implementation** ✅
  - **Performance**: 31.5x faster than vector for circular buffer operations
  - **Throughput**: 544 million operations/second (SPSC)
  - **Key learnings**:
    - Cache line alignment to prevent false sharing
    - Acquire-release memory ordering for lock-free synchronization
    - Power-of-2 bit masking for fast modulo operations
    - Single Producer Single Consumer (SPSC) pattern optimization
    - Proper benchmarking methodology (warmup, multiple runs, fair comparisons)
- [x] **Smart Pointer Deep Dive** ✅
  - **Components**: `UniquePtr`, `SharedPtr`, `WeakPtr`
  - **Performance**: Zero-overhead unique_ptr, lock-free shared_ptr
  - **Key learnings**:
    - RAII and deterministic resource management
    - Move semantics and perfect forwarding
    - Atomic reference counting with `compare_exchange_weak`
    - Memory ordering semantics (relaxed, acquire, release, acq_rel)
    - Breaking circular references with weak pointers
    - Custom deleters and type erasure
    - Control block design for shared ownership
    - Thread-safe reference counting vs object access
- [ ] Advanced Memory Management Techniques

### Phase 2: Concurrency and Performance
- [x] **Memory Pool Allocators** ✅
  - **Performance**: 31.8x faster than new/delete for pure allocation
  - **Throughput**: 724 million operations/second
  - **Key learnings**:
    - Intrusive free list with union for zero overhead
    - Separation of memory lifetime from object lifetime
    - Manual memory management vs RAII trade-offs
    - Placement new and explicit destructor calls
    - Cache-friendly sequential memory layout
- [ ] Lock-Free Data Structures
  - [ ] MPSC Concurrent Queue (with CAS operations)
  - [ ] Lock-Free Hash Map
  - [ ] Atomic Smart Pointers
- [ ] Thread Synchronization Primitives
- [ ] Cache-Aware Programming Techniques

### Phase 3: Low-Latency Design Patterns
- [ ] Zero-Copy Message Passing
- [ ] High-Performance Serialization
- [ ] SIMD and Vectorization Techniques
- [ ] Minimizing Allocation Overhead
- [ ] Context Switching Optimization

## 🛠 Technical Approach
